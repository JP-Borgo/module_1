Hello Professor,

The repo method I liked the most was the VSCode Approach. 

Using a similar approach: 

    - Go to the folder where I inititated a git repo and open folder using VCode
    - Once open I click on Terminal --> New Terminal
    - From here I am able to run any git commands 

Thank you,

Juan Pablo Borgo
